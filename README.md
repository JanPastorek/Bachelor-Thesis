Few words towards this project:

* #### The first goal was to build a scalable non local game environment with database. 

* #### The second goal was to build an algorithm that will be able to search through the strategies for non local game and output/learn the paths to bigger winning probability (CHSH value).  

NonLocalGame provides API for doing operations on versions of nonlocalenvironments.

There are so far four versions of non local environments.

* CHSHPrototype - is just a prototype that uses fixed gates(path) to illustrate how CHSH game (basic nonlocal game) works.

* NlgDiscreteStatesActions - is fully functioning nonlocal game discrete environment optimized for discrete states and actions to be used on this environment. Can either use discrete gates as input, or can use simulated annealing which always chooses suboptimal gate as action.

* NlgGeneticOptimalization - is fully functioning nonlocal game environment where Genetic algorithm optimizes input rotation gates to learn the best possible way to maximize win_accuracy,CHSH value. (could be set also for complex gates) Works best for small games where each has 1 qubit.

* NlgContinuousOptimalization - environment uses NlgGeneticOptimalization to optimize gates that the agent chose each step globally. (very slow)

I built two Reinforcement learning agents to search these environments:

* Basic REGRESSION agent

* DQN agent

* For simple games like CHSH one, one can use another approach - optimalizing gates through genetic algortihm. 

On top of those I built Genetic algorithm that is able to optimalize agents hyperparameters (and also choose the best reward function)
