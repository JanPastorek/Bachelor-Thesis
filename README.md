Few words towards this project:

There are so far five versions of CHSH game.

CHSH v0.1 - is just a prototype that uses fixed gates to illustrate how CHSH game works.

CHSH v0.2 - is full functioning CHSH game where Reinforcement learning agent tries to learn the best possible way to maximize win_accuracy and therefore CHSH value. (main version)

CHSH v0.3 - is right now not functiong and will probably be deleted.

CHSH v0.4 - is functioning CHSH game where Reinforcement learning agent tries to learn the best possible way to maximize win_accuracy and therefore CHSH value, this version however uses different state representation from CHSH v0.2

CHSH v0.5 - is fully functioning CHSH game where Evolutionary algorithm optimizes 4 rotation gates (A0,B0,A1,B1) to learn the best possible way to maximize win_accuracy and therefore CHSH value.
